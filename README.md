# CPM

Abstract:
We study the predictability of cryptocurrency time series. We compare several alternative univariate and multivariate models in point and density forecasting of the coin with the highest market capitalization: Bitcoin. Eventually, after discussing different approaches, we apply a set of predictors and rely on classic statistical models and machine learning methods to combine large sets of data and test them with different forms of time variation. We find statistically significant improvements in forecasting when using combinations of the models and in forecasting when relying on different selections of multivariate models.
